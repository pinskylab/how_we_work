## Process
1. Meetings
- Come prepared and take notes
- Set and follow an agenda
- Start on time; end on time
- Check in regularly about the whole person (or career)
- We will appoint a "lab listener" each semester who will
    - observe and promote healthy lab communication
    - schedule meetings with Malin as needed for issues and updates
2. Project management
- Set realistic deadlines, revise them
- Break projects into smaller pieces
- Do science openly, transparently, and reproducibly
3. Problems
- To report an issue please contact Malin. All communication will be treated as confidential to the extent possible (sexual harrassment and related concerns have to be reported, per [university policy](https://uec.rutgers.edu/policies/title-ix/)
- If you aren't comfortable speaking to Malin: 
    - contact the lab listener
    - contact Marsha Morin, E&E grad student coordinator
- If the grad student coordinator does not sound like the correct point of contact, Rutgers has many resources available to you, including:
    - Counseling, Alcohol, & Other Drug Assistance Program & Psychiatric Services
    - Student of Concern Pathway
    - Student Conduct
    - Violence Prevention and Victim Assistance
