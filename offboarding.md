Exit interview
--------------
Set up a time to talk with your mentor about:
1. What was the best part of being here?
1. What did you learn while you were here?
1. Did you get the support you needed, or could we have been better at it?
1. What can we improve for mentoring someone in your position in the future?

Write-up (for undergrads)
-------------------------
Write up a summary of your work with the following components:
1. Goals of the project
1. Methods
   * detailed enough that someone could replicate your work
   * explain any decisions you made and why
   * link to and describe the input data for the project
   * link to the project outputs
   * include descriptions of metadata, any column headers in data sheets
1. Summary of findings
1. Potential next steps (could be a starting point for you at a later point or someone else)
The write-up can be a markdown document within your repository or a Google Doc. If you use a Google Doc, please link to it from the README within the repository, make sure the settings are such that anyone with the link can access it, and upload a saved pdf version to the repository.
