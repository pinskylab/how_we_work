Welcome to the Global Change Research Group!

-   [Computing Resources](#computing-resources)
-   [Guides and tutorials](#guides-and-tutorials)

There are a few items to take care of now that you have joined the lab.

To Do List
----------

1.  If you're at UCSC, read the [EEB resource guide](https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/eeb/home), especially the section on onboarding.
1.  Read the [GCRG Working Agreement](https://github.com/pinskylab/how_we_work/blob/master/working_agreement.md).
2.  If you're a PhD student, check out Malin's [Notes on a PhD Degree](phd_guide.qmd) (also has some useful postdoc-related resources)
1.  Read the [GCRG Data Management Policy](https://github.com/pinskylab/policies/blob/master/data-management.md).
1.  Get your keys and ID card through UCSC (talk with the EEB Grad Program Coordinator and/or the EEB Assistant Administrator). Add CBB 139 for the GCRG Molecular lab, a key for the CBB analytical labs if you're doing pop gen lab work, and a key for the CBB showers if you want.
1.  Make a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account if you don't have one already.
1.  Ask Roy to help you join our Google Spaces (General, Science Communication, DEIB, Climate Biogeography, Genomics, Random, Lab Meeting, Santa Cruz, Computing & Data, Conferences, Lab Website, Lab Space, and Help Coding) for messaging (a Slack equivalent), our shared google calendar, our [Github Organization](https://github.com/pinskylab), and the [GCRG mailing list (pinsky-lab@googlegroups.com)](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pinsky-lab) (talk to Roy Roberts).
1.  Connect to the "Global Change Research Group" Shared Google Drive by asking Roy to share it with you.
1.  Add your information to the "Global Change Research Group (GCRG) Members" google doc (in the top level of the Global Change Research Group shared drive)
1.  Send your contact information, photo, and web address to Roy to add to our lab webpage [here](https://globalchange.sites.ucsc.edu/people/). If you don't have  webpage, they can help you make a page on our website.
1.  Write an [Independent Development Plan](https://myidp.sciencecareers.org), copy your IDP goals to a new google document in Shared Drive/How_we_work/Group_member_goals/ (see the template in the directory), share it with Malin, and set up a time to discuss it.
1.  If you will be doing lab work, complete the safety training [here](https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/eeb/About-Coastal-Campus/environmental-health-safety).
1.  Download and begin to maintain a reference manager. We recommend Zotero, as the free software interfaces well with both Microsoft Word and Google Docs. Download Zotero and browser plugin [here](https://www.zotero.org/download/).  
1.  Block out our weekly lab meeting time on your calendar, and when you're ready, sign up for a lab meeting.  The easiest way to find the schedule for lab meetings is to look at the GCRG Lab Meeting space under Tasks and the linked google file should pop up.
1.  Sign up for meetings with Malin about every two weeks. The link to his calendar is saved in the GCRG General space under Tasks.
2.  If you're a postdoc, grad student, or staff, talk to Malin if you need an external monitor, harddrive for backups, or external keyboard or trackpad. We can usually provide what you need (funding-dependent).
1.  Read through the relevant guides and tutorials below, depending on your experience.
2.  Join the CBB Coffee Club (2nd floor kitchen) if that's relevant to you.
1.  Spend some time exploring the resources on the GCRG Google Drive and Github Organization. Ask questions about anything that's confusing so that we can make it easier for others in the future!

Computing Resources
-------------------
There are several computing resources available to serve your research computing needs.

**Rutgers**

| owner                        | name        | partition name | number of cores | memory |
|------------------------------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|--------|

| OARC-Ecology node 2 (hal0281)| amarel      | p_deenr_1      | 64              | 256G   |
| OARC-EOAS node (hal0170)     | amarel      | p_eoas_1       | 40              | 192G   |
| OARC                         | amarel      | main           | ~19,000         | ?      |
| RDII                         | caliburn    | -              | 256             | 768G   |


**UCSC**

| owner                        | name        | partition name | number of cores | memory |
|------------------------------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|--------|
| PBSci                         | [Hummingbird](https://hummingbird.ucsc.edu/)    | -              | 24-64/node              | up to 256GB/node   |
| Astrophysics | Lux | - | many | less |
| PBSci | Bishop [archived data] | GlobalChange-bio/ [10TB]| NA | NA |

*Various lab members have differing levels of experience with each of these servers and can help you figure out what is best for your analysis.*
**Amarel** is a condo system. You only have to wait in line with other GCRG folks for the Pinsky node, you have to wait in line with other Ecology folks for the DEENR node, you have to wait in line with all of Rutgers folks for the other nodes.
