# Some notes for a Ph.D.
Notes written by Malin Pinsky, 2013-2024

## Skills to develop
My goal is to help you understand and succeed in our discipline as it is now, while also empowering you with the agency to reshape it in the image of all of us.

- project design
- data analysis and interpretation
- oral presentation: see Scientific presentation tips (to add)
- grant-writing
- manuscript writing
- collaborating and networking in academia
- teaching
- peer reviewing

*(see our onboarding guide for resources)*

## Expectations/Milestones
- Throughout
  - Participate in the community and build your professional network
    - attend all seminars, meet most or all speakers, come to lab meetings, work from CBB
		- Contribute to the community: clean up after yourself, do maintenance, do chores, etc.
	- Reproducibility for collaboration with future self, with others in lab, with others outside lab (see the [Data Management Guide](https://github.com/pinskylab/how_we_work/blob/master/data-management.md))
	- Practice any talks and present any posters to the lab, before you take them to a conference
  - This is will be substantially more work than a 9-5 job or taking classes as an undergraduate or MS student
- First year
  - First meeting topics
    - Expectations for me from you
    - Expectations for you from me
    - Your expectations for the PhD experience
	  - What you want to learn from the PhD
    - Where your are tentatively heading

    - If you have fears, concerns, questions, or just want to talk, please come find me. If you’re upset, please tell me.
  - Apply to fellowships (fall)
  - First year talk (lab meeting or other venue)
  - Start and perhaps finish a first year project that is publishable
  - Comprehensive exam on the first-year courses
  - Read widely across the literature
- Second year
    - Finish courses
    - First year project written up and potentially submitted
    - Read widely and design a dissertation proposal
    - Attend a conference, present a talk or poster
- Third year
    - Write dissertation proposal and defend it, “Qualifying exam"
    - Continue research
    - Attend a conference and present 
- Fourth year
    - Continue research
    - Submit papers
    - Attend a conference and present 
- Fifth year
    - Finish research
    - Submit remaining papers
    - Attend a conference and present 
    - Apply for postdoc fellowships (fall) and contact potential mentors, or network and do informational interviews for non-academic opportunities 
    - Defend dissertation!
        - At least 6 weeks in advance of defense: last draft of dissertation chapter to Malin. Others already be done.
        - Defense date is tentative until
        	- Full dissertation written
         	- At least 2 chapters submitted for publication
          	- All chapters comply with our [Data Management Plan](https://github.com/pinskylab/how_we_work/blob/master/data-management.md)

## 6-Month Check-ins
At the end of the fall and spring, we take a meeting to step back from the details and think about big picture career trajectories. It’s a good chance to go back the goals you wrote for yourself, think about your progress, and think about whether they’re still the right goals for you. Please start a running document of your goals in our Google Drive (how_we_work/Group_member_goals/, make a copy of the template and add your name to the title) and share it with Malin.

This is your meeting to use as you want, but I often find it useful to loosely structure the meeting like this: 

- First 1/3: Highlights from the semester/last six months:
  - What have you done?
  - What have you learned?
  - What connections have you made?
- Last 2/3: Plans for the next six months:
  - What do you want to do?
  - What do you want to learn?
  - What connections do you want to make?
  - How can I support you in that?
- Also let me know if you want me to think about answers to any questions.
- Funding plan during each end-of-year checkin
