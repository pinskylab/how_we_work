We study how species adapt to rapidly changing environments to inform global stewardship and train the next generation of scientific leaders. More about our group’s research can be found on our website.\nThis lab manual resource is intended to provide an overview for lab members and others about how we do our work, and our expectations for our team. It is also a space to document institutional knowledge and for important information about procedures and available resources. Lab protocol and methods can be found in a separate book Pinsky Lab Methods.\nThis book is based on the Feylab Lab Manual. Because this repo existed proir, the Feylab Lab Manual repo was not forked and instead the structure and format were imitated. If interested in creating a similar please visit the Feylab Lab Manual Repo or see Quick steps to making a copy of the lab manual and publishing it!\n\nThis lab is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",

Add CBB 139 for the GCRG Molecular lab, a ley for the CBB analytical labs if you’re doing pop gen lab work, and a key for the CBB showers if you want.\nIf you’re at UCSC, also check out the EEB resource guide\nDownload and begin to maintain a reference manager. We recommend Zotero, as the free software interfaces well with both Microsoft Word and Google Docs. Download Zotero and browser plugin here.\n\nBlock out our weekly lab meeting time on your calendar, and when you’re ready, sign up for a lab meeting. The easiest way to find the schedule for lab meetings is to look at the GCRG Lab Meeting space under Tasks and the linked google file should pop up.\nIf you’re a postdoc, grad student, or staff, talk to Malin if you need an external monitor, harddrive for backups, or external keyboard or trackpad. We can usually provide what you need (funding-dependent).\nRead through the relevant guides and tutorials below, depending on your experience.\nJoin the CBB Coffee Club (2nd floor kitchen) if that’s relevant to you.\nSpend some time exploring the resources on the GCRG Google Drive and Github Organization.
