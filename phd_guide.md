*(see our onboarding guide for resources)*

## Expectations/Milestones
- Throughout
  - Participate in the community and build your professional network
    - attend all seminars, meet most or all speakers, come to lab meetings, work from CBB
		- Contribute to the community: clean up after yourself, do maintenance, do chores, etc.
	- Reproducibility for collaboration with future self, with others in lab, with others outside lab (see the [Data Management Guide](https://github.com/pinskylab/how_we_work/blob/master/data-management.md))
	- Practice any talks and present any posters to the lab, before you take them to a conference
  - This is will be substantially more work than a 9-5 job or taking classes as an undergraduate or MS student
- First year
  - First meeting topics
    - Expectations for me from you
    - Expectations for you from me
    - Your expectations for the PhD experience
	  - What you want to learn from the PhD
    - Where your are tentatively heading
    - First year project?
    - If you have fears, concerns, questions, or just want to talk, please come find me. If you’re upset with me, please tell me.
  - Apply to fellowships (fall)
  - First year talk (lab meeting or other venue)
  - Start and perhaps finish a first year project that is publishable (begin and perhaps finish writing)
  - Attend a conference, present a poster or tal
  - Comprehensive exam on the first-year courses
- Second year
    - Write draft dissertation proposal by January
    - First year paper submitted
    - Attend a conference, present
    - Write dissertation proposal and defend it, “Qualifying exam"
- Third year
    - If not done, finish dissertation proposal and defend it, “Qualifying exam"
    - Continue research
    - Attend a conference and present 
- Fourth year
    - Continue research
    - Submit papers
    - Attend a conference and present 
- Fifth year
    - Finish research
    - Submit remaining papers
    - Defend dissertation
        - At least 6 weeks in advance of defense: last draft of dissertation chapter to Malin. Others must already be done.
        - Defense date is tentative until
        	- Full dissertation written
         	- At least 2 chapters submitted for publication
          	- All chapters comply with our [Data Management Plan](https://github.com/pinskylab/how_we_work/blob/master/data-management.md)
    - Attend a conference and present 
    - Apply for postdoc fellowships (fall) and contact potential mentors, or network and do informational interviews for non-academic opportunities 

## 6-Month Check-ins
At the end of the fall and spring, we take a meeting to step back from the details and think about big picture career trajectories. It’s a good chance to go back the goals you wrote for yourself, think about your progress, and think about whether they’re still the right goals for you. Please start a running document of your goals in our Google Drive (how_we_work/Group_member_goals/, make a copy of the template and add your name to the title) and share it with Malin.

This is your meeting to use as you want, but I often find it useful to loosely structure the meeting like this: 

- First 1/3: Highlights from the semester/last six months:
  - What have you done?
  - What have you learned?
  - What connections have you made?
- Last 2/3: Plans for the next six months:
  - What do you want to do?
  - What do you want to learn?
  - What connections do you want to make?
  - How can I support you in that?
- Also let me know if you want me to think about answers to any questions.
- Funding plan during each end-of-year checkin

	- Coursera
		- Brian Caffo, Mathematical biostatistics boot camp 1 and 2
			- 7 weeks, taught several times per year
			- Recommended by: Columbia Univ PhD student: The teacher and format are very good. But it is pretty elementary; covers what you would learn in a rigorous basic stats course (comment on boot camp 1)
		- Roger Peng, Computing for data analysis
			- in R, generally taught Sept, 4 weeks
			- Recommended by: Tia-Lynn Ashman lab member says excellent, pretty hard, 10-15 hrs per week, covers both data management and stats
		- Jeff Leek, Data analysis
			- in R, generally taught Oct, 8 weeks
			- Recommended by: Brian Caffo read his statistics blog http://simplystatistics.org
		- John McGready, Statistical Reasoning
			- seems to be not available every time I check. aimed at public health
			- Recommended by: Brian Caffo, fantastic course
		- Note: Peng and Leek are collaborators, both at Johns Hopkins. They additionally teach the below but Rae Winfree has not found out more on these courses:
			- R programming
			- Getting and cleaning data
	- Michigan State University Kellogg Biological Station
		- Jennifer Hoey enjoyed them. Not offered every year?
		- Part of CIC (Committee on Institutional Cooperation), so Rutgers students get an "in"
