There are a few items to take care of now that you have joined the lab.

To Do List
----------

1.  Join the [Pinsky Lab Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pinsky-lab) mailing list, Teams, and google calendar.
2.  Connect to the [Pinsky Lab Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/my-drive).
    -   Click the "Shared with Me" link on the left.
    -   Right click on the Pinsky Lab folder and select Add to My Drive. This will not affect the amount of storage available in your google drive.
3.  Add your information to the Pinsky Lab Members google document (in the Pinsky Lab Google Drive folder)/
4.  Read the [Lab Working Agreement](https://github.com/pinskylab/how_we_work/blob/master/working_agreement.md).
5.  Read the [Lab Data Management Policy](https://github.com/pinskylab/policies/blob/master/data-management.md).
6.  Write an [Independent Development Plan](https://myidp.sciencecareers.org) and share it with Malin.
7.  Download and begin to maintain a reference manager. We recommend Zotero, as the free software interfaces well with both Microsoft Word and Google Docs. Download Zotero and browser plugin [here](https://www.zotero.org/download/).  
8.  When you are ready, sign up for a lab meeting this summer.  The easiest way to find the schedule for lab meetings is to search Teams for "lab meeting" and the linked google file should pop up.

Computing Resources
-------------------

There are several computing resources available to serve your research computing needs.

| owner                        | name        | partition name | number of cores | memory |
|------------------------------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|--------|
| Pinsky Lab                   | amphiprion  | -              | 40              | 252G   |
| SEBS                         | annotate    | -              | 72              | 500G   |
| SEBS                         | annotate-win| -              | 18              | 500G   |
| OARC-Pinsky node 1 (hal0181) | amarel      | p_mlp195       | 40              | 128G   |
| OARC-Pinsky node 2 (hal0186) | amarel      | p_mlp195       | 40              | 128G   |
| OARC-Ecology node            | amarel      | p_deenr        | 28              | 128G   |
| OARC-EOAS node               | amarel      | p_eoas_1       | 40              | 128G   |
| OARC                         | amarel      | main           | ?               | ?      |
| RDII                         | caliburn    | -              | 256             | 768G   |

*Various lab members have differing levels of experience with each of these servers and can help you figure out what is best for your analysis.*
**Amarel** is a condo system. You only have to wait in line with other Pinsky Lab folks for the Pinsky node, you have to wait in line with other Ecology folks for the DEENR node, you have to wait in line with all of Rutgers folks for the other nodes.
**Caliburn** is a proposal system. Only people who have submitted proposals and been approved have access to the resources. At the time of this document creation, the Pinsky Lab had access.
