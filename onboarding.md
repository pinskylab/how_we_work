There are a few items to take care of now that you have joined the lab.

To Do List
----------

1.  Read the [Lab Working Agreement](https://github.com/pinskylab/how_we_work/blob/master/working_agreement.md).
1.  Read the [Lab Data Management Policy](https://github.com/pinskylab/policies/blob/master/data-management.md).
1.  Write an [Independent Development Plan](https://myidp.sciencecareers.org), share it with Malin, and set up a time to discuss it.
1.  Make a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and a Google account if you don't have them yet.
2.  Join our Teams group, our shared google calendar, our [Github Organization](https://github.com/pinskylab), and the [GCRG mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pinsky-lab) (talk to Ryan Snow).
4.  Connect to the [GCRG Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/my-drive) by asking Ryan to share it with you. Then:
    -   Click the "Shared with Me" link on the left.
    -   Right click on the Pinsky Lab folder and select Add to My Drive.
5.  Join [Rutgers Box](https://it.rutgers.edu/box/) and ask Ryan Snow and Andrew Campbell to add you to the Pinsky Lab Box folders (to be updated for UCSC)
6.  Add your information to the GCRG Members google document (in the GCRG Google Drive folder)/
7.  Send your contact information, photo, and web address to the lab coordinator to add to our lab webpage [here](https://globalchange.sites.ucsc.edu/people/). If you don't have  webpage, they can help you make a page on our website.
11.  If you will be doing lab work, complete the safety training (to be determined at UCSC).
12.  Download and begin to maintain a reference manager. We recommend Zotero, as the free software interfaces well with both Microsoft Word and Google Docs. Download Zotero and browser plugin [here](https://www.zotero.org/download/).  
13.  Block out our weekly lab meeting time on your calendar, and when you're ready, sign up for a lab meeting.  The easiest way to find the schedule for lab meetings is to search Teams for "lab meeting" and the linked google file should pop up.
14.  Read through the relevant guides and tutorials below, depending on your experience.
15.  Spend some time exploring the resources on the GCRG Google Drive and Github Organization. Ask questions about anything that's confusing so that we can make it easier for others in the future.

Computing Resources
-------------------
*This will be updated for UCSC*
There are several computing resources available to serve your research computing needs.

| owner                        | name        | partition name | number of cores | memory |
|------------------------------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|--------|
| SEBS                         | annotate    | -              | 72              | 500G   |
| SEBS                         | annotate-win| -              | 18              | 500G   |
| OARC-Pinsky node 1 (hal0181) | amarel      | p_mlp195       | 40              | 192G   |
| OARC-Pinsky node 2 (hal0186) | amarel      | p_mlp195       | 40              | 192G   |
| OARC-Ecology node 1 (hal0280)| amarel      | p_deenr_1      | 64              | 256G   |
| OARC-Ecology node 2 (hal0281)| amarel      | p_deenr_1      | 64              | 256G   |
| OARC-EOAS node (hal0170)     | amarel      | p_eoas_1       | 40              | 192G   |
| OARC                         | amarel      | main           | ~19,000         | ?      |
| RDII                         | caliburn    | -              | 256             | 768G   |

*Various lab members have differing levels of experience with each of these servers and can help you figure out what is best for your analysis.*
**Amarel** is a condo system. You only have to wait in line with other GCRG folks for the Pinsky node, you have to wait in line with other Ecology folks for the DEENR node, you have to wait in line with all of Rutgers folks for the other nodes.
**Caliburn** is a proposal system. Only people who have submitted proposals and been approved have access to the resources. At the time of this document creation, the Pinsky Lab had access.
