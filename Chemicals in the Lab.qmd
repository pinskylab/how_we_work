A.3 Recycling Silica Beads
----------
1. One bag at a time pour beads into strainer
2. Pick through with forceps and remove anything that isn’t silica gel and silica with residue
3. Slowly transfer beads from strainer to baking pan or box, still working on that, and while pouring scan for missed debris
4. Take care not to over fill pan
5. After filling, place a paper towel over the beads and move the pan to the drying oven set at 75 C. Let dry overnight.
6. Based on testing 75 C for a longer period of time is fine. All the beads go back to the nice orange color
7. Remove the tray of beads from the drying oven and place into the “Used Not Sterilized” bead container. If left out they will start to collect moisture immediately
8. When ready to make sampling kits weigh out 40 g of beads and place into a ziploc bag. 
9. Do not put hot beads in ziploc bags they will melt straight through it
10. Perform UV sterilization for each bag making sure that beads are not overlapping
