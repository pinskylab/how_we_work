# Pinsky Lab Guide

Welcome! This repo serves as a central hub for information on our values and how we work together. In particular, please see our:

- [Working Agreement](working_agreement.qmd)
- [Onboard Guide](onboarding.qmd) for new members
- [Data Management Guide](data-management.qmd) for open science
- [Notes on a Phd degree in the GCRG](phd_guide.qmd)
- [Offboarding Guide](offboarding.qmd)

It's also worth checking out our [Methods repo](https://github.com/pinskylab/pinskylab_methods), including our [Cookbook](https://github.com/pinskylab/pinskylab_methods/blob/master/cookbook.md) on how to solve common research problems we all face. We also have an older [Laboratory repo](https://pinskylab.github.io/laboratory/).
